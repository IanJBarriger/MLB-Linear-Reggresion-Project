# MLBLinearReggresion

This project used data sourced from baseballreference.com from the years , with the goal to predict season win percentage based on various team statistics. This was a group project consisting of data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model creation, and model testing. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
* R Studio

This data was sourced from baseballreference.com as a CSV file in order to easily import it as a table in R Studio. Using Pandas and Numpy, the data was cleaned by removing missing values, correcting data types, and determining qualifying streams. This cleaned data frame wsa used to analyze listening habits, including Top Artist, Top Songs, time related habits, and total listening times. Key insights were visualized using Tableau where an interactive dashboard was created to show streaming rates for my top 10 artists. These visualizations were important in highlighting and improving accessability, presentation and enabling clear insights into listening behaviors and preferences.

## Dataset:
The dataset includes information about Spotify tracks such as:
* Time Stamp
* Platform
* Milliseconds Played
* Country Streamed
* IP Address
* Track Name
* Artist Name
* Album Name
* Album Name
* Spotify Track URI
* Reason Start
* Reason end

## Lessons Learned:

* Gained proficiency and knowledge in data cleaning techniques using Pandas and Numpy.
* Improved skills in data visualization using Tableau.
* Developed strategies for collecting and produsing a product using a specialized data set.
* Gained knowlege in creating storytelling and presentation through a tablea dashboard.
